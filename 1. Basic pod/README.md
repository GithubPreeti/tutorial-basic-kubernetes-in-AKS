# Basic Pod: Creating a Simple Load Balanced Web Server in Nginx with Kubernetes on Azure (AKS)#

In this lab you'll learn step-by-step how to deploy a pod into Azure Container Service / Managed Kubernetics (AKS) that serves simple HTTP requests through an Nginx load balancer.

## Prerequisites

In order to run the samples in this lab,you will need the following:

- An active [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free "Microsoft Azure") Subscription
- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/overview?view=azure-cli-latest "Azure CLI") installed
- [Curl](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html "Curl") command line tool installed (for downloading kubectl as well as testing samples in this lab)
- [Kubernetes CLI (kubectl)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/ "Kubernetes CLI (kubectl)") installed
- **Resource Group** and **Container Service (AKS)** created in the [Microsoft Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com "Microsoft Azure Portal") to run samples in.

## First time set up ##

If you never used Azure CLI or Kubernetes CLI before or have used it but for a different subscription, you need to link your Azure subscription to the local Kubernetes configuration.

**Kubernetes CLI Local Configuration**

If you are using the Kubernetes CLI on a windows machine, it expects a ```config``` file in this folder location:


    %USERPROFILE%\.kube


For instance, if your user name is TestUser, you may find the kubectl ```config``` file in ```C:\Users\TestUser\.kube```

**Optional:** If your Kubernetes configuration file is located elsewhere, in order for the Kuberneter CLI (kubectl) to find your configuration, you need to add the above path (including the 'config' file name) to the ```KUBECONFIG``` environment variable, as such:

    SET KUBECONFIG=c:\pathtokubeconfig\config

 
**Logging into Azure from the Command Line**

In order for the kubectl statements below to be fired against the correct Azure Kubernetes (AKS) instance, we need to link your Azure subscription to the local Kubernetes configuration.

First you need to sign in,  by entering the following command in a CMD window:


    az login

This will result in the following output:

    To sign in, use a web browser to open the page https://aka.ms/devicelogin and enter the code B9R2CY8ZP to authenticate.
    
Now, you need to open a browser and go to ```https://aka.ms/devicelogin``` and type in the code as returned from the ```az login``` command: ```B9R2CY8ZP```

This will authenticate your device again Azure and a response similar should appear in your CMD window:

    [
      {
	    "cloudName": "AzureCloud",
	    "id": "3b7912c3-ad06-426e-8627-419123727111",
	    "isDefault": true,
	    "name": "CanvizDev",
	    "state": "Enabled",
	    "tenantId": "3dad2b09-9e66-4eb8-9bef-9f44544b0e74",
	    "user": {
	      "name": "Manfredw@canviz.com",
	      "type": "user"
	    }
      }
    ]
    
**Linking your Azure subscription**

Next, you need to link your Azure subscription so that the Azure CLI (```az```) will work against your environment.

    az account set --subscription "3b7912c3-ad06-426e-8627-419123727111" 

**Getting Kubernetes configuration from Azure**

Then, we can make sure we can use **Azure Container Service (AKS)** as our context for when we run ```kubectl``` commands, by entering the following command:

    az aks get-credentials --resource-group TestKub --name TestKub1

where ```TestKub``` is the name of a **Resource Group** you have created for yourself in the Azure Portal and ```TestKub1``` is the name of the **Managed Container Service** (AKS, not ACS!) you created in the Azure Portal. 

If successful, this will result in the following output:

    Merged "TestKub1" as current context in C:\Users\TestUser\.kube\config


**Optionally: Set the context, if you have used other Kubernetes clusters before**

If you have been developing against a local or a different Kubernetes cluster, your current kubectl configuration may point to a different cluster. To correct this, please use the following command:

    kubectl config set-context TestKub1


**Verify the correct Kubernetes cluster**

In order for us to verify that we are talking to the correct Kubernetes cluster, we can use the following command:

    kubectl cluster-info

The output of this command should look similar to this:

    Kubernetes master is running at https://testkub1-77a9ac84.hcp.eastus.azmk8s.io:443
    Heapster is running at https://testkub1-77a9ac84.hcp.eastus.azmk8s.io:443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/heapster/proxy
    KubeDNS is running at https://testkub1-77a9ac84.hcp.eastus.azmk8s.io:443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy
    kubernetes-dashboard is running at https://testkub1-77a9ac84.hcp.eastus.azmk8s.io:443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kubernetes-dashboard/proxy
    
    
## 1. Create an Nginx configuration file

Nginx is an HTTP and reverse proxy server, a mail proxy server, and a generic TCP/UDP proxy server. It is offered as part of Kubernetes as an advanced Layer 7 loadâ€‘balancing solution for exposing Kubernetes services to the Internet.

The way nginx and its modules work is determined in the configuration file. By default, the configuration file is named nginx.conf and placed in the directory /usr/local/nginx/conf , /etc/nginx , or /usr/local/etc/nginx

### 1.1 Default Configuration

Firing up an Nginx instance within Kubernetes is easy:

``` kubectl run my-nginx --image=nginx --replicas=2 --port=80 ```

The ```kubectl run``` line above will create two nginx pods listening on port 80. It will also create a deployment named ```my-nginx``` to ensure that there are always two pods running.

At this point, the two pods are not yet accessible from the outside world. For that we need to create a deployment:

``` kubectl expose deployment my-nginx --port=80 --type=LoadBalancer ```

Now, Kubernetes will create an external IP address for you, so you can access the pods from your web browser.

In order for you to see what IP address is created, you can run the following command:

``` kubectl get services --watch ``` 
> 
> **Note**: the --watch flag will wait for the IP address to be populated and show the assigned ip address once available

Which results in an output similar to this:
    
     kubernetes	ClusterIP  		10.0.0.1  		<none> 		443/TCP			1d  
     my-nginx   LoadBalancer   	10.0.179.76   	<pending>  	80:31102/TCP   	<invalid> 
    
And once the IP address has become available:

    kubernetes ClusterIP  		10.0.0.1  		<none> 			443/TCP			1d
    my-nginx   LoadBalancer   	10.0.179.76   	13.92.209.60   	80:31102/TCP	6m
    

Now, we can use a cURL statement to see if we get a response back from our Nginx instance:

``` curl "http://13.92.209.60" ```

Which should result in an output similar to this:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
    <title>Welcome to nginx!</title>
    <style>
    body {
    width: 35em;
    margin: 0 auto;
    font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;
    }
    </style>
    </head>
    <body>
    <h1>Welcome to nginx!</h1>
    <p>If you see this page, the nginx web server is successfully installed and
    working. Further configuration is required.</p>
    
    <p>For online documentation and support please refer to
    <a href="http://nginx.org/">nginx.org</a>.<br/>
    Commercial support is available at
    <a href="http://nginx.com/">nginx.com</a>.</p>
    
    <p><em>Thank you for using nginx.</em></p>
    </body>
    </html>




However, in the case above the default configuration is used which is not always desired.

### 1.2 Create a custom Nginx configuration for Kubernetes

In order for Kubernetes to start an Nginx instance with **your** configuration, there are a number of steps we need to perform:

1. We need to create a custom Nginx configuration file
2. We need to make the custom Nginx configuration file readable to a Kubernetes pod
3. We need to reference the Nginx configuration from our Pod and Deployment configuration files (written in Yaml format)
3. We need to verify that the custom Nginx configuration file is successfully picked up by Kubernetes during deployment

First, we will generate a custom Nginx configuration. As an example we will be creating a simple Nginx implementation that returns a fixed string ```Gangnam Style!``` for all root level HTTP requests. So, the expected result here for a request like this ```http://13.92.209.60``` is ```Gangnam Style!```

**Sample custom Nginx configuration** ```nginx-basic.conf```:

    server {
    	location / {
    		return 200 'Gangnam Style!';
    		add_header Content-Type text/plain;
    	}
    }
    

Now, in order for Kubernetes to understand this Nginx-specific configuration, we need to make it readable by creating a ```ConfigMap``` object from this. In essence, a ```ConfigMap``` object is a key-value pair that can be mounted to a volume inside the Kubernetes pod.  

If you'd like you can read more about ```ConfigMap``` here: [https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/ "https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/")

**Generating a ConfigMap for the custom Nginx configuration**

In a working folder of your choice, please create a ```conf.d``` sub-folder. Then create a ```nginx-basic.conf``` file in that folder and copy the following configuration code block into the new ```nginx-basic.conf``` file:

    server {
    	location / {
    		return 200 'Gangnam Style!';
    		add_header Content-Type text/plain;
    	}
    }

And save the file. You should now have a ```nginx-basic.conf``` file in the ```conf.d``` folder.

> Note: Unlike some of the examples on the web, ```ConfigMaps``` must be mounted as directories! Not as files. More about this later.
> 

> Note: Also, if you more experienced with Nginx configuration files: Nginx configuration for Kubernetes can not contain any top level configuration attributes such as ```http```, ```worker processes```, etc. 

Now, let's run the command that will generate a ```ConfigMap``` for our custom Nginx configuration file:


    kubectl create configmap basic-config --from-file=conf.d


> Note: Make sure you run this command from the working folder that  contains the ```conf.d``` sub folder you created earlier.   


**Reference our custom Nginx configuration from our Pod and Deployment configuration files**

When we construct our Pod and Deployment Yaml files, we need to make sure we reference our custom Nginx configuration correctly, otherwise the deployment may fail or the deployment will succeed, but with the default Nginx configuration. 

As we will see later when constructing the Pod and Deployment Yaml files, you will see a section in your Yaml files similar to this:

    spec:
      containers:
      - name: basic
        image: nginx
        volumeMounts:
        - name: basic-config
          mountPath: /etc/nginx/conf.d
      volumes:
        - name: basic-config
          configMap:
            name: basic-config
> 
> Note: It is extremely important when constructing Yaml files to follow the exact indentation from the samples for the configuration elements, as Yaml is extremely sensitive to that and your deployment may fail for unclear reasons because of it.

> Note: Also, NO tabs can be used for indentation, only spaces. Make sure your code editor doesn't convert spaces into tabs or adds tabs when adding a carriage return. And also make sure when copy & pasting this code, the indentation isn't changed or replaced by tabs.

## 2. Create a Kubernetes Pod

In this lab we will be creating a simple load balancing Pod that will return a fixed string for a HTTP request. 

In the paragraph above we learned how to create a custom Nginx configuration to return a fixed string from an Nginx implementation and how to create a ConfigMap that can be read by Kubernetes when deploying your pod.

The following Yaml file is used to create our simple load balancing pod:

    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: basic-pod
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: basic
          image: nginx
          volumeMounts:
          - name: basic-config
            mountPath: /etc/nginx/conf.d
      volumes:
        - name: basic-config
          configMap:
            name: basic-config 


Then, we ask Kubernetes to generate the pod for us by using the following command:

    kubectl create -f basic-pod.yaml


## 3. Deploy a Kubernetes Pod

Now the pod should be defined, however this does not yet actually deploy our pod. For that we need to execute the following command:


    kubectl create -f basic-deployment.yaml

## 4. Expose a Kubernetes Pod Deployment
  
Now the deployment is created, however we are not there yet. In order for us to access the deployment from the outside world, we need to expose the deployment by using this command:


    kubectl expose deployment basic-deployment --port=80 --type=LoadBalancer


## 5. Confirm Kubernetes Pod Deployment

### 5.1 List your pods

In order to see if our pods and deployments actually exist and have succeeded, we'll use the following commands:


    kubectl get pods --output=wide

This will result in an output similar to this:

    NAME								READY STATUS	RESTARTS   	AGE   IP			NODE
    basic-deployment-1236939662-mfq4f   1/1   Running   0  			36m   10.244.0.70   aks-agentpool-25428128-1
    basic-deployment-1236939662-rzlqw   1/1   Running   0  			36m   10.244.1.91   aks-agentpool-25428128-0
    basic-pod   						1/1   Running   0  			36m   10.244.0.69   aks-agentpool-25428128-1
    
The items ```basic-deployment-1236939662-mfq4f``` and ```basic-deployment-1236939662-rzlqw``` refer to the two replicas as defined in your ```basic-deployment.yaml``` file. 

The ```basic-pod``` refers to the pod we created with ```basic-pod.yaml```.

Note: if the STATUS is not running, there are several things you can do to debug the issue (see below).

### 5.2 List your deployments

By executing the following command, we'll be notified when AKS has issued an IP address for our pod so we can test it from the outside world. 

    kubectl get services --watch


Which will result in an output similar to this:

    NAME   				TYPE   			CLUSTER-IP		EXTERNAL-IP		PORT(S)			AGE
    basic-deployment   	LoadBalancer   	10.0.163.91   	52.186.69.82   	80:31277/TCP   	1h


## 6. Test the Kubernetes Pod Deployment

Since AKS issued an EXTERNAL-IP as we can see from the output of our  kubectl get services statement, we can now go to a web browser and navigate to http://52.186.69.82  or use cURL to see the output of our load balanced custom Nginx implementation:

    curl "http://52.186.69.82/" 

Which should result in the following output:

    gangnam style!

        

## 7. Debugging your Kubernetes Pod Deployment

Deploying a pod, deployment or a service with Kubernetes can be a daunting task. 

However, here are a few commands that will be able to guide you potential problems with your configuration:

### 7.1. Inspect the active configuration of a pod

After you have executed the statement ```kubectl get pods``` you will get a list of pods and their unique names:

    NAME								READY STATUS	RESTARTS   	AGE
    basic-deployment-1236939662-mfq4f   1/1   Running   0  			1h
    basic-deployment-1236939662-rzlqw   1/1   Running   0  			1h
    basic-pod   						1/1   Running   0  			1h
    
Then, by executing the following command, you can get back from Kubernetes the Yaml configuration that it used to deploy that particular pod:


    kubectl get pod basic-deployment-1236939662-mfq4f -o yaml

This can give you information on which Nginx configuration is actually used. If the output of the statement above doesn't match the Yaml you provided this may point you in the right direction of solving your issue. 

### 7.2. Inspecting the logs of a pod

The following statement returns the logs of a pod:

kubectl logs basic-deployment-1236939662-mfq4f

Which in case the pod is running correctly, returns an output similar to this:


    10.240.0.5 - - [16/Feb/2018:21:50:31 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 14 "-" "curl/7.58.0" "-"

If there is something wrong with the pod, deployment or the load balancer, the result from this statement may be an empty string.
